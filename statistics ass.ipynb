    "Ans-**Descriptive Statistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involve the use of numerical and graphical methods to summarize and present data in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Let's consider a dataset containing the ages of students in a classroom: {18, 19, 20, 21, 22}. Descriptive statistics for this dataset would include measures\n",
    "like the mean (average), median (middle value), and standard deviation (a measure of the spread). Calculating the mean age, which in this case is 20, provides a central value that\n",
    "represents the typical age of the students in the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inferential Statistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics involve making inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. It uses probability theory to make educated guesses about the population parameters. Inferential statistics allow researchers to draw conclusions about a larger group based on the observations from a subset of that group.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Suppose a researcher wants to know the average age of all students in a city and doesn't have access to all the students. They take a random sample of 100 students, calculate the mean age from this sample, and use inferential statistics to make an educated guess (an inference) about the average age of all students in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scope:** Descriptive statistics describe and summarize data, providing insights into its main features. Inferential statistics, on the other hand, make predictions or inferences about a larger population based on a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Purpose:** Descriptive statistics are used to present and organize data in a meaningful way, making it easier to understand. Inferential statistics are used to make predictions, test hypotheses, and draw conclusions about populations based on samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example:** Descriptive statistics include measures like mean, median, and standard deviation. Inferential statistics include techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
